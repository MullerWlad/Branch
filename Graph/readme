Manual:

- Constructing: 
    let graph = new Graph() - empty
    let graph = new Graph(2, "3", "5") - it writes just "3", "5" because of "only string for names"

- Getters: 
    - graph.graph - returns object of graph
    - graph.names - returns names of graph
    - graph.nodes - reurns values of names
    - graph.connections - returns connections of names
    - graph.getPowerOf(name) - returns power of nodes
    - graph.getNodeOf(name) - returns value of name
    - graph.getConnectionOf(name) - returns names that are connected with name
    - graph.getCompositionOf(name) - returns all names that are connected with name and another names that are connected with names
    - graph.eq() - returns result of building equivalance from general connections

- Setters:
    - graph.setNodeOf(name, value) - sets value of name
    - graph.setConnectionOf(name, ...nodeNames) - sets connections of name
    - graph.addConnection(name, nodeName) - adds connection to name
    - graph.createNameOf(name) - adds name to graph

- Removers:
    - graph.deleteNodeOf(name) - deletes name of graph and removes it from all objects
    - graph.deleteConnectionOf(name, nodeName) - deletes connection from name
    - graph.emptyConnection() - deletes all connections of name

- Makers:
    - graph.cut(name) - cuts graph using 
        Getters: - graph.getCompositionOf, but without name
